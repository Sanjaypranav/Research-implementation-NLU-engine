1,It's not that all lives don't matter
1,Is it really that difficult to understand? Black lives matter and all lives matter are not mutually exclusive. They are both true as general statements. So are white lives matter and asian lives matter. Black lives matter in this context is simply the name of a movement against the strangely high rate of police violence on black people and the statement is referring to those who behave like and treat black people as if they dont matter. For example
1,Whenever we say black isn't that racists?  Why don't just say Americans.

Just ask Hal Lindsey.   People have been predicting the end with scripture for the last 2000 years.

1,This is ridiculous.  No one can have an open and free debate and discussion.   To say all lives matter is perfectly reasonable yet is met with derision.   All white politicians are in fear and terror.

1,I just hear insecurities being voiced. Not a single legit complain in this video. Men deal with the same stuff
0,@Amazing Worenwu all lives means we are all equal
0,+Ancient Soul oh Lord. I don't think you'll ever understand. There's a specific context in which the black lives matter movement arose. Because black people were being killed and there were multiple incidents of the same type of thing. What exactly is the context for the all lives matter movement and focusing on the whole world? It was only created as a combatant otherwise it wouldn't even exist. No one is blaming white people. We're saying stop killing black people unjustly. That's it. Obviously there are other problems going. Probably more important ones too. But are people not allowed to stand up for themselves without being attacked? Would you not like to be able to stand up for yourself without being opposed? That's all this is about but sadly I don't think you'll be able to understand no matter which way I put it

1,@Teehee hi First off
1,@Jamie Ryan Storey i think Madonna holds a bigger grudge than Cyndi does on her.  Cyndi always speaks highly of Madonna and i find it odd (again) almost every interview with Cyndi .. Madonna is brought up in the conversation .. but with Madonna interviews; no mention of Cyndi.  One thing that would be difficult to accomplish with both them in the same room working on a project; discipline.  Madonna IS very disciplined.  Cyndi is scattered.  But both are very creative and passionate about their work.  Definitely two worlds colliding.
1,I also thought that  but in the end

1,It‚Äôs ashamed that you were met with ridicule after saying ‚ÄúAll lives matter‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt agree with trashing someone who may not understand the cause. In short saying ‚Äú All lives matter‚Äù in response to ‚ÄúBlack lives matter‚Äù can come off as dismissive and purposefully missing the point. BLM at its core is not meant to divide or ridicule but to bring awareness. Hopefully your conversations on the subject (should you continue to have one) end with more acceptance and understanding rather than anger and insults. Best of luck

1,peter gunn yeah if you wanna come I am always ready to take you around
1,All lives matter doesn‚Äôt make no logical sense because it‚Äôs white people who are suffering. BLM is like saying Black Lives matter too. It‚Äôs not saying Only Black Lives Matter. Too say all lives matter or white lives matter isn‚Äôt rational and of course you are gonna get booed. It‚Äôs because white people are being killed by the police for no reason. White people arent being discriminated against. White people got it made. Not all white people but the majority of America is white people. And not even 100 years ago my grandpa couldn‚Äôt use the same restrooms as white people. So saying all lives matter is like a chicken protesting against the wolf and the wolf saying their life matters too. Of course it does. But it‚Äôs not what the movement is about. So please shut up when you say all lives matter. No matter what you mean by it.
1,Truth hurts. BLM just can't handle the Truth!

0,That's probably because they're still in the closet due to their christian brainwashing from their church. It happens a lot in Christian communities. Usually when they start to live outside that community then theh might just might come out. I grew up in a Christian community so I say this from seeing my LGBTQ friends come out not until their early 20s or even later. I love them all which is one of the many reasons why I am not Christian anymore. The churches thinking they have the right to judge. Check yourselves Christians read Romans 1

1,#BlackLivesMatter isnt about being better than other races its about making people aware of what black people go through that other groups don't. If white people where constantly being discriminated against they would actually have a reason to say whitelivesmatter. All lives matter makes people feel like it's is just there to downgrade what Blacklivesmatter really stands for.
0,@t0bias busterud You are missing my point. I find it impossible to understand that a movement that is trying to redress inequality has a main banner statement  of inequality. I am not putting the importance of any race over any other. The statement White Lives Matter is just as wrong as Black Lives Matter. I am sure the movement has some valid points but the cause is not helped by a provocative banner. All Lives Matter would be perfect for the movement because it wouldn't diminish the impact and it would show absolute unity and equal opportunity for everyone going forward. I believe this would garner additional support from all areas of all communities.
1,Kudos to Wired for not trying to stifle and censor discussion although I had to check to see if I accidentally clicked on a Buzzfeed link. The beauty of all STEM fields is the objectivity in deciding who is most qualified for a job. Listening to the ladies speak I got no sense of an actual systemic issue in the field but more that they are just insecure about  themselves and how they interact with colleagues.

You don't care about lives lost.  Liars. You don't care about racism. Nonsense. You're not in a battle for civil rights. You're liars who treat an entire race like they are children.

1,@SepherStar Well I would partly disagree. Even train drivers in the US are known as engineers as apart from driving train engines they are expected to know the nitty gritties of their engines as well as troubleshoot engine problems when in operation. What I meant by working with hands (exaggeration) was that skilled engineers are more hands-on with practical experience on shop floor or on site in case of projects. This is precisely why women are misfits in a field like engineering cuz they are dependent mostly on technicians and do not like to take orders from their managers (submissive attitude) due to ego problems. (Managers would rarely shout orders to female sub-ordinates lest they get sued for sexual harassment... so instead of giving orders to their female sub-ordinates

1,Joannot Fampionona You are not seeing the problem. These women engineers are saying only women get questioned when they are new which isn't true. Every new engineer has gotten the look for the experienced ones but this is another feminist excuse to cry racism
1,Ramon Murray Holy fuck I never said capitalism is a system of ethics. I said that in reply to a previous comment trying to justify sexism with capitalism i.e. just because it's what happens doesn't mean it's the right thing.nnAnd I'm talking about physical abilities because that was the excuse given to me (read my previous comment) when I was declined a hangar rec.

I have a classmate who is bisexual (it‚Äôs a girl) and she absolutely loves girls but she can‚Äôt be in an open relationship because her parents would despise her if they ever found out. Being against someone who is LGBT is basically being against people‚Äôs existence and everyone has the right to live their lives as they see fit.

1,is this iraq???
1,The elephant in the room just needs to be mentioned. When we say Black Lives Matter a lot of people don‚Äôt understand what it really means so they call it racist.  I Know people that are white and Hispanic that held up the sign during the George Floyd protest. The reason why they did this was not  because they wanted to be black But  because they knew what it meant . In short it means that we matter  to but we feel like people that aren‚Äôt our color in general don‚Äôt recognize that we do. We know all lives matter everybody should know that. God loves us all but we don‚Äôt love us all.

1,Panji Rizki the term homophobic has a historical relationship with the AIDS epidemic. Fear of LGBTQ can be based on or surrounded by fear of HIV/AIDS during the last century. I‚Äôm not sure anyone who disagrees with your faith would associate that with any malady. Though
1,I think in general we all get along pretty well. Even with some democrats.
1,I really love this interview. All the pretension is gone. No phony accent. No self-inflation. Just insightful reflection and real humility.
1,I love the end
1,Jessica Walker that‚Äôs because a lot of Christians try to force their religions down others‚Äô throats. Why should I respect someone for their beliefs when they can‚Äôt even respect mine?
1,If you can‚Äôt say all lives matter then your racist. But the new norm is black lives matter only. Absolutely ridiculous what white people have to deal with.

1,this all a publicity stunt from the dems
1,@Mr. carpenter bee maybe I should have used the word indoctrinate not brainwashed. nobody forces an adolescent to believe in a religion but they are more prone to believing certain views if they grew up with that religion being the norm. But if they leave that community and are able to think outside that norm then they might question several aspects but when someone is under a certain age they just go with the flow of their communities norms unless it causes them pain. There have been many LGBTQ youth in religious communities who are shunned when they come out. Just think of the implications and pressures someone has to go through when their community does not accept them. in my opinion
1,AKA conversion torture
1,@Luke B Ah did not know about Pride wanting to have no police company outside of their participants. Still that should have nothing to do with option for Pride to call police for help.nnStill sounds silly. Police in first place should be conscious about enforcing law both on citizens and within themselve.nThat is what I am paying taxes for. Not for them to prance around doing nothing but looking good.nThat is different business called Modelling.

0,I just want to point out that the Bible does not say that homosexuality is a sin. The passage that I‚Äôve always seen sited has been proven to be translated incorrectly and is actually condemning pedophilia rather than homosexuality. ‚ÄúMen shall not lay with man‚Äù was originally meant to read as ‚Äúman shall not lay with boy‚Äù. Homosexuality is never condemned. Please do research and learn about the origins of the book you claim to worship. Incorrect translations and interpretation of God‚Äôs words are harming real people on a daily basis.

1,Isn't the majority of killings of Black lives in America actually by other black individuals?   I highly value Black lives I have traveled to Nigeria twice and to Rwanda twice to teach workshops on how to save newborn babies at birth.  These babies happen to be Black and I have worked in hospitals to save people of all races.   My understanding is there are a whole lot more black lives lost though in the United States due to Violence among the Afro American community in impoverished neighborhoods.   To focus on the police as a critical solution to the loss of Black lives and to take actions that are not precisely calibrated will result in a great increase in the loss of Black lives.   The police have been serving the Black community.   Yes there have been incidences of abuse by police just as there have been nurses that purposefully killed their patients but we don't decide to get rid of nurses because of these few  crazy ones.   After all Black lives matter right?

The problem inherent in this situation arises when the BLM movement embodies radical principles that threaten the lives of other groups or lawful systems.r  The movement's dynamic shifts from peacefully calling attention to the oppression of the black race to radically lashing out with violence or hate speech under a logic process that can be summed up as two wrongs make us right.  Bottom line

1,That's what they mean. The problem is that they think they are  targeted by systemic racism. That's the issue that needs to be addressed and why they get upset when we respond with  all lives matter .nThey don't like us disagreeing with their narrative that black people are oppressed.

1,I thought engineers were great problem solvers. That's the biggest part of the job. These women aren't getting jobs because their perspective isn't professional and will cause conflict. The conflict lacks productivity and company's want money at the end of the day. These women aren't problem solvers their bitches. No one hires a bitch male or female.

How does any of that help me when I am spotted by a satanic cop.

Now sexually I don't support it but I will be there for anyone who is. I support people not for what they do but for their spirit and compassion towards everyone. Pls don't come at me

1,Yup. She's most definitely a lesbian but probably hasn't even allowed herself to entertain those thoughts due to her church. She'll find her way eventually.

1,I always watch and never comment but I just gotta say that your work is amazing. People who say 'don't talk to kids about this stuff
0,ALL LIVES MATTER. To say anything else is ridiculous. To be equal is to be considered as a whole. There are unfair things that happen and people need to be held accountable. But to divide ourselves is not helping anything

1,POLICE LIVES MATTER. I BELIEVE THE COP IN FERGUSON WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF. I KNOW THE STORIES AND watched them all. that cop had every right to protect himself. he felt threatened and Michael Brown did try to get the officers gun so the officers life would have been at risk so like anyone trying to protect themselves the officer did the right thing.

1,Daiyan Farrel Keigo Hartono BLM are protesting across Europe and the UK...it‚Äôs not just the USA these protests are occurring.   One of my points is for the BLM spokespersons to look at the big picture and give a voice to modern day slaves who are currently bought and sold from within the African continent.  Asian people are employed under false pretences of employment and forced into the sex trade or slave labour.  So rather than wasting all that energy looting and ripping statues down why don‚Äôt BLM focus and protest on something that‚Äôs happening right now.  Pulling a statue down achieves nothing!
1,ImAlfie I agree! But I don‚Äôt think anyone made her say that. What if she actually believes in the Bible maybe?üßê

0,@NOXISUM you really couldn't have been more racist with that comment. I'm African American and I support the all lives matter statement. You sit there and say white people make it about them. Uhhh no it's not just white people its every other non black race and they're not trying to bash this protest. But why can't it just be about police brutality and racism in general. Black people and white people get hated on all the time and that goes the same for Asians and Hispanics. The all lives matter thing is saying police brutality needs to end and so does racism. And do you really think black people aren't racist against white people. I just saw a video of a group of black people beating the sh!t out of white people and setting their cars on fire. Like what kinda response is that. It seems like you think only black people know struggle racially or otherwise and that's just not true.

But I was really really confused and hated myself because I couldn't understand why God would hate me if I like girls. Which for me made me try to prove even more that I didn't like girls at all. I finally left the religion two years ago and came out as bisexual. It's really scary if your family is homophobic and tell you that you are damned forever for that...

1,For you thickheaded folks that don‚Äôt seem to understand what BLM means... it DOES NOT mean that the lives of other races don‚Äôt matter or don‚Äôt matter as much. It is a response to America showing us that Black lives have not mattered equally to other lives. BLM is simply a reminder that
1,@Jake Harrison That's your opinion man.

1,@Average Murican statistics wise yes more White people are killed by Cops then black people.   But Also Statistics Wise more (Unarmed) Black people are killed by Cops there's a Difference.   Also Anyone Who has a Counter Protest like All Lives Matter are a Racist or Bigot because they don't care how many (Unarmed) (unjustly) Black people are being killed so once White privilege is Taken away ND White Supremacy we will have peace.

1,@Bailee Beckett In fact
1,@Dirieh Ngongo Black lives mattered since the civil rights act was passed in 1964. Everyone knows black lives matter in the modern day and age. But you cannot shy away from the fact that there are and always will be individual racists by constructing a movement that is completely counterproductive to the African American community. Blaming it on factors such as systematic racism that clearly doesn't exist for black people. Let's take college acceptance for example. A black candidate for being a student in the school premise is more sawn after than a person of yellow colour with the same qualifications. Now tell me how you guys have it worse that isn't of your own doing. By creating this victim mentality you literally take all hope away from them with the lies you radicals have created.
1,BLM is indeed an organization who has their own beliefs and stand for different things. But BLM is a statement or phrase that stands for the fact that black lives matter too. Please don‚Äôt take our phrase and try to make it political. It‚Äôs not some political agenda. It is used to signal black empowerment. We don‚Äôt all agree on the political side of the BLM organization

0,@S. Tagerius I was really impressed with your ability to communicate the horrific implications of conversion therapy and support of the LGBT+ community.. but completely shocked and disappointed that you are advocating that abortion is killing a baby. Why is it that you think LGBT+ individuals are worthy of bodily autonomy but women aren't worthy of having autonomy over their bodies??
1,@Melissa Rose No one. It's a fictional story. They didn't exist.
1,not gonna lie... sounds like a horse race. All lives matter no matter who you are
0,Some of the black lives matter people are doing things correctly to protect their people but there are some that are destructive against innocent people and bad people too.When someone says black lives matter it is rude to say all lives matter because the purpose of this movement is black protection for their people and it‚Äôs rude to bring other lives to erase its main purpose.Its like saying ‚ÄúMy cousin died help me‚Äùthen person two replying who cares mine died too.Respecting personal rights means world peace .

Also maybe to get back at mommy and daddy for some trinket or such that the kid wanted. When they didn't get it they joined the BLM movement. Same as those celebs from Holkyweird cause it's the newest thing to spend their money on so they can feel good about helping some poor kids starving. nThey don't realize the devil has a grip on their souls.

Saying ‚ÄúAll live matters‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdult lives matter‚Äù is undermining the message. Obviously all lives matter. But it‚Äôs not black lives matter and not anyone else. They are saying their lives also matter.
1,The democratis are basically saying that they don‚Äôt matter

At the very least they could have called it black lives matter too at least that indicates to some degree that you give a shit about other people other than your own kind.  I swear you need to think when trying to start a movement like this.

1,Hai Huynh I do do research and that does happen. I feel like you‚Äôre only looking at black people who are getting killed and dismissing the other races that are also getting killing in the same way. Have you seen the videos about random bricks being left in the middle of protests? Or how there are triangle holes being left in glass windows where riots and looters happen. There‚Äôs under cover stuff going on. Blm is pretty much like a cover up for an agenda to take place. It‚Äôs making people have hate in their hearts and causing destruction. That movement isn‚Äôt helping anything at all but only making the left come up with up ways to continue salving people who are black.

1,Do you not see how saying all lives matter gaslights and undermines blm? You need to understand when someone says blm they are not saying other lives don‚Äôt matter they are saying black lives matter too. Blm just wants people to treat black people equally not above or below.

1,WHAT EVERY ONE FORGETS IS THAT THE STATUE IS THERE FOR THE WORK HE DID nFOR THE POOR. by this measure we have to pull down every statue that pren dates 1833 in England. the other point id like to raise is that it is nlikely that roughly 99% of ppl in the crowd are wearing or carrying somen thing made in a sweat shop there fore are using modern slavery. This isn just mob stupidity i bet a large proportion of ppl didn't even know then name of the guy on the statue as it fell. i believe the world should ben a meritocracy where people are just people and not labeled by arbitraryn factors.

The passage that I‚Äôve always seen sited has been proven to be translated incorrectly and is actually condemning pedophilia rather than homosexuality. ‚ÄúMan shall not lay with man‚Äù was originally meant to read as ‚Äúman shall not lay with boy‚Äù. Homosexuality is never condemned. Please do research and learn about the origins of the book you claim to worship.

1,OMG sounds like a bunch of unattractive women whining.
1,God did NOT create the human races
1,Very reasonable and well thought out. I agree and further more can add that a number such as the ratio of men to women in engineering fields does not show there is a problem. Rather this demonstrates that despite a  level playing field women as a whole don't want to be or may dream about it but are not willing to put in the work as frequently as men are. I was listening to a consultant for law firms talk about female lawyers and the legal field has a hard time hanging on to female partners after 30 years old. This iss not based on their skills because they will have earned their place

1,The problem is that there is no way to reasonably or logically argue against LGBTQ without saying the word god.  The separation of church and state is a thing.  The problem we have with Christians is that they are trying to legislate the rules of their religion into law and putting religion above people in disowning and/or kicking out their kids or other family members for being LGBTQ.

I've started engineering projects this year and they have been well received by all (boys and girls).nnIn reply to the comment about men not being in elementary Ed. I don't see men as not being encouraged to be teachers. There is no culture saying men aren't smart enough to be teachers. However it seems girls may think they are not smart enough. A lot of it is misconceptions about what engineers are and do.nnIn response to the victim comment. She is being an example for young girls that even if you are told you can't do something you should try again and not give up. Teaching young girls to persevere and work hard is not a bad thing.

1,Jeff Davis statistically white people are born in a better economic situation than most black ppl. We also have a higher median income than the black community in every class. Black ppl also have a much lower chance of being accepted for a traditional mortgage.

I‚Äôm sure there are more examples of systemic racism but I‚Äôd have to research more. I hope this changes ur view.

0,My parents gave my brother all the next latest and greatest electronics that were coming out during early 2000s and they use to give me all the pretty dolls and role play toys typical for girls. nThey thought he was going to be a programmer cuz he played a lot of computer games but he decided to major in art and I majored in computer science lol! I didn't even know I liked programming until I took an intro cs course during my senior year of high school. nI always knew I had kind of an engineering mentality growing up because I liked taking scraps from the recycling bin and building random things from it. I even made houses for my dolls and ignored the store bought doll house my parents gave to me for my birthday.nThis really inspires and reassures me that I'm making the right choices for my path. I might even consider after i complete my computer science degree to go pursue engineering as well.

0,Y‚Äôall really need to let go. Yes we know all lives matter. That‚Äôs a given.

We know like white lives matter that has been proven that white lives matter over all of her lives in America time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again. Nobody has ever questioned if all lives matter. So that part of the conversation is over with and irrelevant. Now let‚Äôs concentrate on the lives that have not mattered in America. Please concentrate and focus on what needs to be done to help. Don‚Äôt concentrate on what needs to be done to perpetuate the current paradigm. It is time for a change. All lies has always mattered and white lives has mattered above all in black lives has mattered the least in America. Stay focused people..

1,George FIoyd held a preg Woman at gunpoint in 2007. George Floyd was the trigger but black lives matter is not about him. There were many Georges before him and there will be a lot more killed by cops until the killing ends. It sucks that the black person that triggered all this was an actual criminal ... we have to look beyond just one bad man and focus on the message
1,It‚Äôs stupid to say All Lives Matter because we already know.
0,The truth is All lives matter
1,The reply from the Sheriff was
0,She doesn't sound like a victim to me. She sounds like an engineer. I tried this. It didn't work so I tried that. I figured out this. Then I tried that. It worked.
1,It's a tricky and divisive campaign. And that's what it is.
1,For ages I thought BLM was a type of sandwich.
1,BLM = COMMUNIST .

1,Hydross 77 are you agreeing that blm matters before alm? or...
0,I'm sorry to say this but I don't think that she can do very much in order to inspire girls to become engineers with her product as it still heavily relies on the parents buying them. I believe that the real issue isn't getting girls interested in engineering but rather to prevent parents from pushing their kids into stereotypical roles because I think that the families that buy Miss Sterling's books are the same that would have also gotten their girls a variety of toys
1,I have to agree
1,Why? Because the world became a sad sad place full of snowflakes who get offended by literarly anything.
1,Does the short haired girl have like insta or something

1,D D I think because it‚Äôs more of you in the US
1,Let me tell you what
1,Mike F. Yes child prostitution is awful but quite frankly is unrelated to the topic of racism against the black community. I honestly don‚Äôt understand what point you were trying to make here. Are you suggesting racism isn‚Äôt an issue and people should stop whinging?
1,Will people PLEASE STOP pulling down public toilets for sea gulls
1,The news media insights the riots and hatred.
1,I guess they forgot to talk what's happening in seattle
1,Sooooooo brown lives dnt matter?
1,Btw don't apologize for offending anyone. Not saying whatever you want and holding back leads to suppression of speech which eventually leads to tyranny in short. Not many people know about why America was born . Yes they were slave owners but tell me one person in this country whos ancestors weren't owned from 3000 or more years ago till now. We all have been slaves. We are all still slaves to the monetary system really. We're still here fighting each other about color when there's a bigger picture just behind the lies you see everyday

1,It's never a good idea to make a political statement on YouTube

1,Sea Doggo well stereotypes exist for a reason. they do have some truth in them
1,@Molly Rebekah You seem bit annoyed with me. That's not very Christ like ü§≠.

1,@Molly Rebekah It's fine if you believe in him. But to make definite statements of his existence and expecting them to hold up as a counter point is foolish.
1,@Vanesa Criminal like you who is spreading hate on the YouTube comment section
1,From listening to them speak about their experiences I feel like most of them are externalising internal fears and prejudices they feel should exist and hold themselves back rather than there being some pervasive and rampant problem. Fewer women than men comprise the workforce but what is the percentage of women that study these fields and what is the percentage of women that actively search for a job in those fields?nnThis is a fairly emotional study of a few women that seem to have grown up with a belief that a bias existed and still does. This isn't a level headed representation of the industry today and leads to nothing but personal speculation. Completely pointless.
1,BLM is procrime and just ridiculous.
1,It‚Äôs actually rehabilitation just like an addict they under go rehabilitation
0,I don‚Äôt really understand the idea of people assuming people‚Äôs sexuality based on their appearance. Like we are fighting against stereotypes but still are using stereotypes.

1,Because the channel is ‚Äúwoke‚Äù
1,@Xean Frost you just compared hundreds upon hundreds of years of oppression with a minor inconvenience. please open up your mind and see how life is for people. just because you lack melanin doesn't inherently mean you lack compassion
1,By saying only black lives matter enough times
1,@Pamela Frances That is the point I am trying to make. These people feel ire against a statue yet continue to live in a city which prospered during the slave trade. There are two options for them

Now I'm sure someone is going to comment about how many more innocent whites people get killed by cops then black people. Guess what that's police brutality too cops are pigs. Empowered by a system that has historically discriminated against POC where am I wrong? Go.

1,@BBC Censored Jesus was never a black man you disrespectful moron. As a black person I'm ashamed of you. Did you never learn that he was a middle eastern? Where in the hell did you learn he was black? You are so selfish into thinking everything is black and is all about you.

1,it would be nice if She and Cyndi Lauper finally did something together... song or tv appearance ... it's odd that they have been at the same place / same time ... but never photographed together.  I know Madonna is a strong ally .... but I feel that Cyndi Lauper has done so much more but doesn't get the proper thank you the way Madonna does.

1,@Hai Huynh  One thing that is left out and never clarified is the behavior of the person who is being sought by the police. Why is it a justification for that person to run or get away from the cops or do other things that will escalate the matter? You think it's OK to do things like that to the police? Does this give them cause to disobey and we should just let them off free just because they're black and their lives matter?  It's thoughts like these that have criminals getting out of jail and running free to continue doing crimes because dumb people think it's OK. Then when these criminals go out and hurt others

It always seems like everyone else in class is understanding except me. I try so hard and barely make it. I wonder if I'm just setting my self up for failure. Like what am I doing to myself? Is this worth it in the end? Will i make it to the end? This video really touched me and made me understand that we can do this! So what if we are the only girls. So what if we don't do it right the first time. Let's keep going and not give up.

Oh I forgot FOX didn't want you to know that. nnOh you might want to know the Trump Foundation was shut down by regulators. Trump was using the money for himself. Oh my I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.

1,I want that COAT !!!!! Bless anyone who suffers from persecution.
1,@h5b12345 The point of her saying that she did not fit in was not because she's saying that she didn't have friends or that she was shunned. She did repeat the statement I do not fit in multiple times but that was for effect. It is called repetition for effect. But what she was trying to say was that she did not fit in because she was in a room full of OTHER MEN. That's the whole point of this TED Talk. She's not blaming on the lack of skills to become an engineer but rather pointing out a flaw in the societal view on gender norms here in the United States and the impact this has on kids and their decisions in the future. As a current mechanical engineer at the NYU School of Engineering

1,You sound a little racist to me. My father is coloured and my mother is white. From my point of view blm is a hate group that doesn't actually care about black. Where is thier bleeding heart for all the blacks killed by black people? You wont hear a peep out of them but when a police officer shoots a thug they come out and protest. All lives matter! Red black white yellow we are all human beings.
0,I'm lesbian and one thing that bothers me is when supporters of LGBTQ get all mad when some people dont agree with us and call that homophobic. Being homophobic is way different then not agreeing with LGBTQ. Like the majority of these kids arent necessarily supporters and dont necessarily agree with it
1,Its the complete opposite at this point
1,Wouldn't it be racist to assume someone else is? Asking for a friend.

1,Yuvi Kang I really want to agree with you brother but I can‚Äôt blindly just say that cops are racist. I need some form of evidence via an academic reference or government report that can conclude that there is a racial bias for police officers all throughout America. As for white privilege

0,This was such a heartfelt Ted talk & really hit home for me as an industrial engineer in my senior year. Especially personally this week because I have dealt my whole college life with doubters and disbelievers in my intelligence and diligence & to realize I'm not alone in feeling alone was very awakening and motivating. I'm so inspired to inspire young females to dare to challenge societal pressures and expectations and open the minds of the close minded. An engineer once asked me what it was like to be in a mans world and I replied with I'm used to it and it's not a mans world

1,Saying all lives matter is like the same thing as going to the doctor for a broken arm and expecting a full body cast you can make the argument that all lives matter which is true but we need to fix what is broken first. Nobody is saying other lives don‚Äôt matter of course they do but black lives are the ones at risk right now we‚Äôre just saying we matter too.

They might struggle doing manual labor such as using a jack-hammer but mentally the are equal to males. Its just the way kids are programed. Most parents don't even do it intentionally but¬†each gender is programed to do certain things so by the time they grow up they are on auto pilot. They can't tell you why they like doing this or that because they were program to do certain jobs while they were young. That's why each gender tend to do certain job.nnIts takes guts to say NO!

1,@connie schuiling What the he do you think is going on right now. We are using Americans as guinea pigs. Trump is willing to risk any amount of lives to get a vaccine on the market before the election. Unless the CDC slows his dumbass down many Americans might die.
1,ALL LIVES MATTER. To say any different is racist.

1,#NAME?
1,@tadhg scanlon and statistically black people suffer from abortion more than white people do. And statistically black families 70% of them have father absentee rate. But then again so are a lot of white people. It's a cultural thing we live in a free country where everybody has equal opportunity to dig themselves out of where they're at and make something of themselves. I suggest you start watching some Candace Owens
1,She still comes off entitled
1,He means because god made the girl and the boy for something
1,@UCcJ1GJwW-6qgQgOIKxBalEQ i know what it can mean but most people using the term 'allliveematter' are using it not as a protest but as a way for equality

1,WHY CLINTON IS NOT UNDER CONTROL? SHE IS N TRIAL THE F SHE IS ON TV?
1,People keep talking about the rioting and looting
1,the point of the outrage over that star is because that allows you to completely ignore how Hillary is the most corrupt candidate in history and instead of talking about that talk about how awful Trump is because he didn't have people look at it and try and decide is there any way this could be construed as racist or anti-semitic or in some way make Trump look bad pointing out Hillary is crooked
1,So the MS Paint shapes are becoming racist...nnNot surprised
1,Black lives Matter around the world!

0,I am American women and I work with 2 black women and I showed up to work when 1 or the other need to be relieved nnSometimes I don't get a day off. I do my part as a caregiver. I don't say much. I got wiped with a woden spon when I learned English in my Afrikaans School since all South Africans has to learn 3 languages.  If I misspell a word in English.  It was hard learning English in my hometown.  It wasn't easy
1,I like the Interviewer. He's very respectful and smiled the entire time. He didn't ask any dumb questions

1,k k who's annie
1,@James Johnson¬†??? but are you claiming that women are just as strong as men? When men could do it much better
0,It‚Äôs a fact but it‚Äôs not the case at this time. We don‚Äôt have oppression at such a large scale by ‚Äòall races‚Äô. There are problems in the black community that needs to be fixed at this very moment. Of course all lives matter but saying all lives matter against black lives matter is like math. You have a problem you need to solve so you solve one problem at the time
1,+E = MC HAMMER so that makes the murder of the black men acceptable? if some guy gets revenge then it's fine if a cop kills someone? your logic is not consistent.
1,Why? Because some internet people will dislike a video about sexism in work places (including tech industry)?nIt's crazy
1,@Carola Lavin nKeep it real please
0,Yes like theres no differences We are all humans

1,Thays because right now thats the thing that matters the most.
1,#NAME?
1,Neo-Blshevism in full effect.
1,@Michael Paysour to cut wages and work hours because of it people dont realise that stuff costs money like that socialist Bernie sander who doesn't understand that free college is not even a thing because the only way to support it is by taxes and people who save money and work 2 jobs to pay for their children's college and their is people who waste money instead of saving for their debt. In reality obama was not a great president and he was only praised because he was black his affordable health care just made the majority of people to pay for others and had 50% rise you are just proving the point that democrats want the black vote that is really only worth 15% of the American population
1,Because that never happened? People just like to brand cop killers as BLM after the fact to set up a false narrative. None of the killers had any ties to BLM besides being black.

1,Linda Godinez To compare the state of the industry at the time of Marie Curie to the mountains of progress we have made since is disheartening. You are searching for a sexist argument here when I'm not presenting one. The statistics clearly show a trend
1,Adrian...? I thought his name was George!  LOL!
1,Why? Because black people are racist.
1,@Mark Slima hes got another 4 years in the bag already because of idiots like you thanks. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
1,MB G black lives haven‚Äôt mattered since they were enslaved and brought to this country. Police brutality is big issue that many people of color deal with. Too many black lives have been lost by the hands of police. No to little reform have been made to help this issue
1,BLM is a sham
1,Sheriff Clarke is probably the most logical person on that panel

1,I'm personally against- well not against; i guess just not for- homosexuality
1,Inspiration is good
1,@Jamie Ryan Storey i think Madonna holds a bigger grudge than Cyndi does on her.  Cyndi always speaks highly of Madonna and i find it odd (again) almost every interview with Cyndi .. Madonna is brought up in the conversation .. but with Madonna interviews; no mention of Cyndi.  One thing that would be difficult to accomplish with both them in the same room working on a project; discipline.  Madonna IS very disciplined.  Cyndi is scattered.  But both are very creative and passionate about their work.  Definitely two worlds colliding.
1,@Molly Rebekah i really dont understand here
1,SHERIFF DAVID CLARK and LARRY ELDERS are typical of Most BLACK Americans in this Country
0,I don‚Äôt think testing school kids on science is really indicative of STEM aptitude. Girls brains develop faster and they are typically better students early on. Also
1,exactly. I agree with you 100%.

1,Racisum is being past down. You just dont realise in what way. MOST racists ive met have been black. Often turning issues that have nothing to do with race into a race thing.
1,Don't forget about the one earing.
1,@Zach Jerde Are you purposefully being obtuse or do you truly not understand why some people don't identify as either male or female? Also the whole 'lollll i identify as an attack helicopter roflll' stopped being funny 4 years ago
1,@Tracey Henderson Dont answer people like them. That's what they thay want
1,And here we are
1,@bluefavorites BTW sorry my comment and thoughts are what is getting the most news coverage. I guess by your logic that means that in wasting my time and just typing at a computer
1,@Mr Wrong Socks Can't take you seriously if you're LARPing as a Nazi.
1,Exactly right. The perfect of example why they HATE ALL LIVES MATTER. Its black ONLY! They dont like whites
1,The news news to star showing more of the good

1,@yazz s.  Those who live in sin
1,Please be a troll.
1,1500 homophobic disliked this
1,How about we put it this way. Kid tells their parents they're a boy. Parents will be confused
1,Maggie Paul but if people say all lives matter it gets back lash ?
1,YuhakushoWeebtard but black lives matter has a cause. Black people are being shot and killed by cops and it‚Äôs wrong. There‚Äôs no current reason rn because if anything racist small minded people already believe that they are above black people which they are not. So it‚Äôs just a snarky and irrelevant comeback for a real problem.

1,sandinyourshoes so that doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with cops killing black people solely because they are blackü§¶‚Äç

1,GavinChase isn't the red pill the same name as that reddit thread used by wannabe pick up artists that depict women as money hungry whores and men as horny pigs? nnThen the movie starts off by criticizing feminism in general and calling it a hate group. Which
1,No it‚Äôs  not !!
1,The Black Sheriff IS AWESOME!!
1,@Kansuke Nelson The majority of African Americans do not agree with BLM because first off
1,I agree with everything said here about how weird it is for all lives matter to be controversial. I would like to say though that we must not become like the Democrats as I found it a bit disrespectful for the sherriff to be interrupting when the man who was talking was making his point.
1,Floyd killed in a democrats' turf to cause blame on Trump administration
1,jo ma straight people be trippin
1,Can we get an extended version of Marcus & Jules?
1,Yeah  like all lives matter is equality.
0,sara leong I love science as well!!! But it is extremely hard for me to focus in math. Mainly because (probably because of classes arrangements) I am one of the only three girls in my math class of 12 and almost all the boys didn't know what staying on topic meant. They would yell and chat loudly. The teacher just seems to not hear them (probably because she has learned that it gave her less headaches). Anyways I love legos as well! I hope there's more people like you and your family in the world!!!
1,For he will rescue the poor who cry for help

1,You're correct on pronouncing Pakistan.
1,@Sam JAYROE  Dude what??  Have you Googled the definition of the blm movement?  ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter (BLM) is an organized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality against [black] people.‚Äù
1,This is the first time I've ever seen her like this.  She has changed.
1,Yes and it should of been sprayed all over the protestors and let them pay for there own hospital care
1,Please have this sheriff for the next black president
1,Yes - it would probably help if the government hadn't just killed 50 000 people.
1,Personally I do not have an exact conclusion of if there is or there is a lack of a god. I feel like religions have their standpoint on how they want to look at life and I think that aethiests have a separate way to look at our existence
1,Hey im going to study electromechanical engineer but i didt pay very attention to this.I never thought that all the student will be boys omg im scared where did i get?!

1,@Jessica Walker I actually agree
1,She's sad because it was an emotional evening taped on the same evening as the award show when she just gave her speech. Besides no one will ever allow her to age

1,It's not disagreeing with the fact that the attraction exists and that people experience it; it's disagreeing with the opinion that it's okay to act on that attraction. nnPeople disagree about stuff all the time but still love each other and respect each other's validity and intrinsic value.
1,Thanks a lot from Poland. <3
1,you gotta hate Larry Elder...why?  He speaks with data...this man has more courage in his pinky finger nail than 95% of democrats and especially any liberal under 30.  Black lives matter...tell the black fathers

1,@FamilyFirst Well Democrats supported Obama
1,Police fear those who would dehumanize and kill them in cold blood because of some deep seated sense of entitlement
1,@GmV-arts it isnt. There is another better analogy.
0,The protesters (rioters) seem to favor the herd immunity strategy regarding the pandemic. No social distancing
0,These kids are really mature and understanding! nThe girl with short hair probably didn't grow up in a environment that allowed her to develop her own opinions and values
1,And western companies fund them. Evil exists regardless of race.
1,That mindset their is the problem
1,I think that people who put a black lives matter sign on their front lawn are probably overcompensating for their previous racism and should therefore be reported to black lives matter.

1,i want to speak up and say that i agree
1,What's so amazing is that she knows firsthand of what she speaks. Who would know and why should you care? Live and let live right? It's all great except the deception part. What does it take to be famous and what does it cost? It's a dark and dangerous thing.
1,@Hello World and what is stating someones actions and personality racist?
1,Stop whining and just prove that you're capable of what you say your capable of
1,@The Real Rhetoric Exactly what I was thinking.
1,Amazing how those numbers are SO much better for all Americans and the dimocrats still hate our President Trump
1,Generational poverty is a thing. We need welfare reform that will help teaching people how to come off assistance. There is a gap that causes them to not be able to make the leap into success.

1,Ya'll are saying God wants us to love everyone. Get the love that God wants you to use straight. Different types of love are used. Loving someone with the same gender isn't love but lust.
1,Because there are MORE lives that matter and the last I checked saying all lives matter excludes NOBODY. But the devil is in the details and the Democrats are demons and they have done nothing to help the black community! I USED to be a Democrat until I did my own research and stopped listening to these BIASED DNC controlled media outlets. These are the times of REVELATIONS!!

1,+J Brown let me also clarify something yes there are bad cops and by no means do I support them I'm just saying that before you go saying all the cops in the world are bad remember those cops does that sound a little more reasonable of an answer course it's going to be bad people that's bad everyone and I don't support those cops are bad cops in this world yes I agree with you on that and both live shouldn't matter that's what I'm trying to say

0,We are missing the best female talent. There may be females that are truly interested but not encouraged (as in told about engineering not forced) or bullied out of it (there have been studies that show capable females leave STEM because they are bullied by peers or faculty). I do not force anyone into a field they are not interested in - I have a cousin that would be capable but not interested. I tell her to do what she likes. But there are females that would like it - we need to find them. A diverse workforce makes it a better workforce. Crash tests were only conducted using males dummies until females engineers got involved and saw there needed to be tests on females as well! Females and males do approach problems in different ways

1,Saying all lives matter is not a problem but treating all lives with the same respect is the problem and if that is not happening then it's clear that all lives don't matter you can't go around as a police killing black people and on the other hand arresting white people clearly all lives doesn't  matter
1,That video clip should be posted online under a definition of 'Pandering'.   The Irish guy is the only one who meant what he said.

1,Black panthers and last poets were anti-gay. So was Malcolm X. nBlack Lives Matter movement is against the nuclear family and they are pro-marxist as they admit this on their website. This isn't a black movement... it's an LGBTQ movement for gays & pro-welfare state agenda disguised as a black movement. nnBLM remained quiet during the shootings on fathers day where over 100 black on black killings took place. The reason they didn't address it is because they didn't want to bring focus to fathers day as it would go against their beliefs.
1,All lives matter you sickening liberals !! Except maybe for the lives of violent criminals

1,Cuffed jeans are fashion statement
1,@Charter Jet Affiliate the police in general do believe that. Don't listen to the news media villify them. A few bad eggs don't make the whole police force dangerous. The police are responsible for keeping civility in this country. The minute they are made a non-factor chaos and anarchy ensues.
0,Remember what Martin Luther King Jr said that every body should be treated equally. So black people can‚Äôt even listen to there own race with out even saying BLM. Because if Blacks mattered and whites didn‚Äôt then we aren‚Äôt treated equally. Cut the BS and help our future crisis for GD!

1,@pepsi Atlas I'm white and proud of my ancestors and my skin colour!! Does that make me a racist!!?
0,Saying All lives matter can be offensive for the same reason black lives matter can be offensive to some. Black Lives Matter is an offensive saying because to some¬†¬†it insinuates that the majority of non blacks think that black lives don't matter and that the majority of non blacks are racist when there is absolutely¬†no physical evidence to support that thought. So obviously¬†to a non racist non black that¬†is a grossly¬†offensive notion. Now All Lives Matter can be offensive to some blacks because¬†to them¬†it insinuates that they¬†only care about black lives and that they're saying other lives don't matter when if you¬†actually try¬†comprehend their perspective
1,@Jimmy The Clown
1,@Sweet_Luna Bae shut up snowflake. You don't live in Africa

1,I find the discrimination of every kind horrendous and Nazi
1,@Nataliah Griffin how is Greek Mythology Witchcraft ?
1,People say Black lives Matter becasue it is obvious that many Americans think they don't matter.  The slogan does not day Only Black lives mattter.  Saying all lives matter is a way to avoid saying that Black lives matter.  It has been adopted by racists around the country.  400 years of history (which many refuse to acknowledge) prove that black lives do not matter to many Americans.
1,You see the reason for the saying black lives matter is too raise awareness of how many black people are victims of oppression. A better way to put it is Black Lives Matters Too. So when people say all lives matter it is a true statement but contradicts Black Lives Matter.
1,Look at this offended black boy

There will always be those in the world that do not see the person for the special person that they are. It isn't right. I just have to believe that those who promote hate through discrimination will answer for it when they stand before God.

0,The sad thing is this is the least abusive conversion therapy I've ever heard of. My friends have scars and burns where they were shocked and burned and tortured.

1,The Catholic priests say otherwise. She's not mother Teresa who actually lived in poverty even though she won 1.5 million with a novel priest prize and really saved lives and souls. Madonna is a woman who lives for herself and had two abortions. nShe's a rich performer with a messed up life and she is not a role model. Take what you can but beware. Eventually she will poison you.
1,Hope is for the ones who love God. Good is evil. Madonna will turn to Christ before she dies and get saved and for this blessing i ask in the holy name of Jesus Christ! Amen.

Video after video proves that many of these claims of police brutality are complete bullshit or they are edited without context to spread the anti police narrative by unscrupulous ‚Äú social media influencers‚Äù. All this does is make it more difficult for the good police who are protecting our streets and people who actually are victims of excessive force.

1,Maybe replace it with a statue of Jimmy Savile to celebrate all the money he made for charity.
1,It is not an offense.. All lives mattering was NEVER a question. Can I ask the significance of responding a BLM with ALM?...I just don't see the reason why it is a must for you to say ALM when we ALREADY know that was never an issue.
1,Ur confused. Saying all lives matter is like saying that my house is burning down. But ur house is perfectly fine and I'm likey house needs help and ur like what about my house doesn't my house matter? All houses matter not just the burning ones. Black lives matter too

Look up the crime statistics if you want to know why so many blacks are being killed by the police.

If all lives matter than we will all prosper as it should be. When only one race matters it is doomed to fail because to actually be a true success all lives unite to combat what's wrong.
1,All Lives Matter came as a response to hearing [ONLY] Black Lives Mater when it is meant to be read Black Lives Matter [ALSO]; so saying it is merely a way to show opposition. Using this phrasing of words has been done for some time in modern English

1,So as a white person who defends black lives matters in some sort of riot/protest and I get killed for it whether it be cops or other opposition rioters if I die does my life matter for the cause are a white mane or is it ignored as only this means black lives matters???? So.......white lives or if I was Indian or Asian or whatever represented if they die they don‚Äôt. Matter ????

0,@TheCounterpointer Funny. Typical misogynist. You say feminists are stupid for thinking there's discrimination against women in stem fields just because women make up such minority but then use the same statistics to make a point how women being minority in some fields means they're biologically inferior or not capable of doing something and you just assume men are better at everything.So hilarious and sexist

0,I think this is so biased hiho. Honestly way too biased to be represented in this way to kids. Not fair. nWhat he said ‚Äò‚Äúreligious people don‚Äôt like gays‚Äù is so wrong.

1,They were told leave the statues. They hold different meaning and values about history. We cannot keep thinking it's all about race. It's over the top of reason and doubt. The truth will be told about plans schemes regulators a d who wants to without outwardly saying so. It's looking more like history wasn't kept right. Not really...we don't go away. General Lee is part of history. Now they are charged with destruction of property and lueting. By lies. You'd wanted so much more. It wasn't to start anytime sweety.

1,Smokeed  although for what I don‚Äôt get at the same time believe me before it was that one rogue cop that did something to George Floyd George Floyd was actually a criminal before all of this news coverage and got arrested a couple of times before the media covered him I mean all lives matter is saying it in equality that all lives matter this means black white everyone not in a deserve to live or die that I decided by the justice system if they committed crime but everyone has the same rights in this great nation even black conservatives don‚Äôt like the BLM movement for it does not even help the real black community but sometimes the opposite

But the thing that i hate is that these people are basically saying with all these stupid percentages that men need to change and help women into engineering and men are the problem that there aren't really any women in that field. And that is completely wrong the main reason that there aren't any women in engineering is because women just don't choose to go into that line of work. it's as simple as that.

1,They‚Äôre all just saying this for a vote I think it is racist just to say black lives matter but to say all lives matter means that you care about everybody to say just black lives matter sounds like only black peoples lives matter and not white not Spanish not anybody else‚Äôs So to make it fair for everybody it‚Äôs all lives matter everybody‚Äôs life no matter what race

1,@karennIf you do not uphold the Christian values
1,Saying Black Lives Matter is a shout of rebellion against the fact that black lives are not being TREATED as though they mattered.  And that is certainly true. While All Lives Matter is certainly the better way to think and live (and I would support it more than any other approach)
1,The girl that wasn‚Äôt accepting of homosexuality is giving a bad rep. Presbyterians are some of the most accepting people I‚Äôve met and there‚Äôs plenty of people in both of the Presbyterian churches I‚Äôve attended and they‚Äôve widely accepted before they became members or started attending.

1,To be brutally honest I think that the Hong Kong is more important
1,most of them won't because of criminal background. im talking about all nationality's here. there is police brutality but it ain't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. they should be held accountable for wrongful actions but then there are even video's of activist dealing with police training scenario's and they shoot just as fast. it's hypocrisy.
0,Ik I thought she would get emotional because they would be able to relate.... but then again sometimes it takes a long time to come to terms with the ‚Äúweird‚Äù feelings you feel so she may be repressing them... there‚Äôs a lot of discomfort on her face throughout the video and honestly I think she fears someone is going to ‚Äúdrag her out of the closet‚Äù. Growing up I dealt with that same kind of fear not because my family wouldn‚Äôt accept me because I knew they would but I was scared I wouldn‚Äôt accept me... idek if that made sense but overall she could just be fighting this internal battle that her true self hasn‚Äôt fully won yet
1,Aren‚Äôt you all American

1,Slavery existed in Africa thousands of years before any white man set foot on its shore but in American schools the only slavery you are taught about is the transatlantic slave trade. About every ethnicity that exist was at one time involved in slavery. In America this is the generation of entitlement and victimhood. The crown of victimhood is worn with great pride by those who never experienced any form of slavery
1,@gamerxj To many people Chinese lives don't matter either after Cov-19. Is it any better to say Chinese lives matter?

I understand that everyone is different and is free to believe in what they want but if you are against homosexuality because of the bible then simply think of how God would much prefer you to spread kindness than hate. At the end of the day if you don‚Äôt agree with it then simply keep it to yourself and think before you spread hate! ‚Äç

1,@night light   The Egyptian indigenous are Not the Egyptian of today . The true ancient Egypt is a tribal called Nubian. They're still largely present in the southern Egyptian  valley.  They're black basically as Egypt is already geographical located in African. Morocco. Tunisia.algeria and Libya were all black once upon a time. However they're still black citizens  in those countries  but live in countrysides. Modern Egyptian falsified the Egyptian history of nubian but many know the fact. Go to Google and time Nubian.

1,No they should not be removed. The meaning of the statues will have changed over the generations. Some like the one pulled down represented orginally the good he did for Bristol. The statue became known more recently as  a sign of repression. Now the statue has gone the struggle will have been forgotten. The statue had served a purpose.
0,Ashton Levry I get what you're saying but at the same time why should they defend people that we say all lives matter if we're all created equal shouldn't there be all right for us to say all lives matter because honestly I think we do matter we all matter but even if you're what you're saying is true then it shouldn't hurt your feelings that we say all lives matter no offense

1,Haitch Smith but to say you won‚Äôt say black lives matter because you were bullied as a kid is ludicrous. You‚Äôre condemning an entire racial group just because a few black kids bullied you. I‚Äôm sure they weren‚Äôt the greatest people but that‚Äôs to say everyone in your racial group are evil and should be punished accordingly. Makes no sense
1,Police are gutless. Hampered by years of Political correctness. They need to get the batons out and get on top of these thugs. Can't believe they stood back and watched this happen. Pathetic.

1,@GamerXP3 the minute you mention white privilege is the minute your credibility dies. That's an ad hominem attack to demean white people and make our accomplishments essentially worthless. It's an excuse. A fallacy. The black community won't change until they take responsibility for their own actions. The community wont change until they stop blaming white people for all of their problems. I don't want to hear about privilege coming from minorities considering they get to live illegally here and get hand outs because they don't want to work. It's a logical fallacy.

How are you going to cure someone by hitting them and make them repeat the same thing over and over again on a daily basis ? This is no therapy. There's nothing therapeutic in being hurt or brainwashed. How do we still call those... things therapies ? This is nothing more than legal abuse. Parents who send their child there would say i'm sending my child in a place where they will be abused both mentally and physically if they were honest about themselves. Then add the usual I love them and see if it makes sense.

1,ah i'm in tears. he's such a strong person for always being unapologetically himself
1,@Molly Rebekah You don't know what I know about the Bible or religion in general. Paul never met Jesus and if Jesus ever wanted to say anything about homosexuality he could said it himself if it was important. Through his own teachings and even his sermon on the mount Jesus spoke about many topics. Homosexuality was never a topic. The closest he ever got to speaking on sexuality was with his discussion about marriage where he talked about Eunuchs in Matthew 19
1,If you're black you can say white lives doesn't matter and nobody will say anything and it is not considered racist but if a white says all lives matter it's racism..... I don't get today's society I really don't. And yes ALL LIVES MATTER.

That is what Martin Luther King protested and today the industrial military is far more extreme.

1,statistics wise yes more White people are killed by Cops then black people.   But Also Statistics Wise more (Unarmed) Black people are killed by Cops there's a Difference.   Also Anyone Who has a Counter Protest like All Lives Matter are a Racist or Bigot because they don't care how many (Unarmed) (unjustly) Black people are being killed so once White privilege is Taken away ND White Supremacy we will have peace.

0,If I had to pick which is more feminist I would say the exposing American Feminism is more accurate than the 'modest' Muslim Feminism. I think society is better overall when women are more revealing than mean or at least have full liberty to show as much or as few as they want. I am not for public nudity but even as a Christian I know lust can happen in all levels of clothing so might as well let woman show what they got.

I don‚Äôt know if it would be the same if we weren‚Äôt a majority but all the girls went on to become engineers

In my town meetings and day to day conversations it‚Äôs a prominent topic. I agree that it must absolutely be addressed more and dealt with. I suppose news outlets don‚Äôt find the topic profitable so it‚Äôs left out only to be used in a divisive manner.

1,Aside from all the stereotypes
1,Here's my question. Why do black or most black people hate All Lives Matter? Could it be that black folks in america don't give a crap about any other race but their own? Wasn't the black people from Africa the real slave owners and slave traders of their own kind? Do they ever protest if the cop was black instead of white or some other race?

A female student asked him to go for a drink and he actually went back to the family he was staying with and asked them Is this allowed in your country? Is this OK? because it's not allowed in Saudi Arabia. So you can't possibly equate Islam to feminism.

1,@Soul-Ring Games It doesn't matter if she didn't say it literally. She implied that just because it happened to her it might happen to Annie (which might literally not happen). People have to just respect her opinion and I can see a lot of people here don't.
1,So is your face! That's why you don't have a profile picture.
1,My opinion...Black LIves Matter is both a phrase as well as a political organization founded by three community activists with a socialist agenda. When you say black lives matter you may believe you are simply supporting a slogan but you are also empowering the leftest organization of that name. According to White House records the organizers were coordinating and meeting with the Obama Administration in the aftermath of Ferguson as the group was being founded and are closely aligned with the Democratic Party. It is clever strategy to use what sounds like a well meaning slogan as the name for a political organization with a much larger agenda.

White privilege is not a blanket concept that works the same way everywhere the way you and the rest of BLM want to make it seem.

Someone in another country does an atrosity and we end up with people crowding our local town scaring people and spreading the virus and potentially killing people by doing so.  It's like pent up lock down syndrome... . Please think of other ways to show us your views. I am white and might not get exactly what you mean or misunderstand. How about having an mp who just does black rights  in the uk.  The NHS etc have enough to do right now with riaki g there lives against the virs... Which includes black and white staff at risk.

1,I would fire each one of these woman anybody who whines and complains like this needs to be fired you will make excuses every time crap doesn't go your way everyone has to prove themselves in engineering and a lot of feels like that because you do not get a free pass just because you've had success you have to prove yourself each time that goes for men older people younger people woman groups and individuals anyone can fall out of favor and anyone can succeed over others if people look at you a certain way when you walk in a room probably because you are a big whiny complainer and they know they're going to have to deal with your BS constantly whining about this and that that has nothing to do with the work if affirmative action was gone tomorrow these people would be the first on the chopping block they make office spaces work environments and team groups in hospitable towards each other because everyone has to step around eggshells with them end of demoralizing the and the whole office atmosphere

1,When people say all lives matters its derogatory to the black lives movement this movement stand for the political injustice that black people face just walking down the streets dresses in a suspicious manner. So when you say all lives matter you make it as though all lives face this same issue. Naturally all lives matter is that even a question. But the problem here is when you say all lives matter you indirectly denounce the problems faced by victims of racist police brutality by also indirectly implying that all lives face this problem

Now you‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs deliberate and designed to be provocative to get people talking...you can‚Äôt see the hypocrisy here? nI get they want to be heard and feel like they haven‚Äôt been treated as equals but the message should always be equality. It should always be about bringing everyone together and making them realise we are all the same regardless of skin colour. Nobody should be made to feel racially attacked or victimised in a movement to stop that very thing happening. n‚ÄúSo why should they pander to white comfort and preach a slogan that keeps white people in that comfort space‚Äù again it‚Äôs comments like this that implies all white people are the problem here which simply isn‚Äôt true. You can‚Äôt fight racism while attacking an entire group of people based on their skin colour

1,@Tom Comiskey I don't feel like we need reparations. We lost a war. Part of my tribes treaty is that there will be peace as long as we don't have a standing military force. It happened in the past and I feel like it turned out better than ot could have since most losing nations are the ones that have to pay reparations after wars. Now if the U.S. broke up and there was a war again or with another tribe then I would think the winners would get the spoils.

All masculine girls are not lesbians and if you walked up to an actual lesbian and told them they look like they like girls they'd probably be offended. The irony of attacking someone for homophobia while being homophobic yourself.

1,it is controversial to say 'all lives matter' because a large portion of the black community demand they be pandered to and they don't give a crap about anyone but themselves; they also don't want to take any accountability for their actions and feel entitled to things they never worked for or earned; let me know if i'm leaving anything out...

1,Lmao keep talking about a guy who aimed with a gun at a pregnant woman and did other bad things. It's kinda sad to see this kind of person getting that much attention
0,Ill be honest this speech did not inspire me. She made it seem like they don't encourage women to do well in engineering. As a Chemical Engineering student I have been nothing but supported by teachers and other classmates in my program to succeed and do well. The STEM field wants more women in the field... women just don't choose to be in the field. The majority of women want to be in other careers like teaching or business. Most of the girls that I have talked to ask me why I would want to be into a major like this. It's not a problem of women not being encouraged to be in engineering

1,@Jessica Walker oh my god...like common...im religious..but im pretty sure that some books in the bible were lost....and most of them were books of women...second of bible has been translated into different languages which may cause errors and misunderstandings.....ik ur have ur own opinion..but telling a person there love for a person of their own gender...which they were born with just like straight people...is a sin because its gods words. I think god would rather accept the people who show love to everyone and dont think that something a person is born with is a sin or crime. Just saying. Just love everyone who isnt anyone.
1,@Serhiy Vereshchak statistics say the opposite...
0,Jessica Walker - ‚Äúnot agreeing‚Äù still isn‚Äôt the right context. Not LIKING makes more sense. When you say you don‚Äôt ‚Äúagree‚Äù with something it‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre responding to someone who wants your permission or is asking for your permission to be themselves. You not liking something because of the hate that‚Äôs been imbedded inside you via a book where a man walks on water and snakes talk is YOUR personal issue.
1,Most white people just will never be able to understand why black people do what they do.nnI don't if it is due to a lack of empathy or they just don't care.

1,Liz Cee BLM protests have made a difference. In Louisville there enacting reforms to no-knock warrants so tht cases like Breonna Taylor will hopefully no longer happen. Cities like LA and NYC have promised to cut funding of police departments and presumably invest in low income neighborhoods. So saying tht BLM isn‚Äôt helping in regards to police reform is ignorant.

1,its all lives matter to say black lives matter is racist. racism does know color to begin with. recently if ppl look on utube. a black cop beat up a Hispanic guy that couldnt speak english. it is the reverse racism in the country. white cops are considered racist rite off the bat. but does the music industry do anything about in hip hop song the use of the N word no but if it was a white rapper then it would be racist.

1,Wish they were demonstrating about UK political prisoners such as Julian Assange.
1,There was no All lives matter movement before the Black lives matter movement. Saying all lives matter exists with the sole function of being a counter argument or distraction to civil rights issues. Obviously the police and a large percentage of white people do not actually believe that all lives matter. All lives matter quite specifically exists and ONLY exists to oppose the statement that black people matter. How is this hard to comprehend? Do the doctors refuse you  care when you're injured because all patients matter?

1,If this conlon guy was actually a slave trader then i ncompletely support removing the statue. I only have 1 problem with this video. Which is the protestors dumping the statue at the bottom of a habour. Thus making bristol seem like a kip full of hoodlums who dont care about their areas appearance. Not to mention their environment as a whole. If they really wanted to make a point then they should've just found a way to bring the statue down to the city council and leave it outside.

1,I agree
0,I think we should collectively agree to not label this as therapy. This is not therapeutic at all. This is abuse. Covering it up with a medical term when its not even medical in nature  (hitting someone with a book is physical abuse/repeating verses meant to break your will for hours a day is mental abuse) is disrespectful to the field of medicine which serves to help and cure people. Gayness does not to be cured. It is not a disease. It is not a choice. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Now lets respect one another and help stop this abuse.

1,@Vladimir Putin I respect your feelings 100%
1,I just do not understand why people don't realize that she's a top witch Satanist and all of her videos and everything and so much of what she does totally is obvious and prove that and she's just part of the new world order to brainwash people for the agenda for the transgender agenda for all that stuff cuz she actually is transgender and people need to do their research cuz her recent show she just did was completely Satanist New World Order shows the end time stuff and people really need to watch who they worship and look up to because people worship this woman and she's a Satan worshipper
1,She lost me at her claim about engineers ...solving things like global warming...nKind of difficult to solve a problem that occurs naturally in the cosmos.
1,perhaps it is controversial because it misses the point when another black person is killed over something very minor by the police. if they were to protest with signs saying all lives matter

1,Her voice has changed
1,great speech!! here in Spain I so curious
1,Girl I feel like that way too
0,I dont understand why it is up to anyone else but yourself to make the decision to become an engineer or whatever. The great thing about america or any other nation that is similar is that if you work hard you can accomplish pretty much anything you set your mind to. Obviously you need to network and some luck but saying you need to get more diversity just to get more diversity is absurd. I dont care who the engineer that helps make my bridge

0,@Molly Rebekah I¬¥m heterosexual. Saying I don¬¥t agree with homosexuality seems to me so weird like  I don¬¥t agree with red-haired people.  Homosexuals and red-haired people don¬¥t need your blessing or permission. You believe in your god if you want but

1,@TAIPLAYZ Exactly. I was thinking of several extremely famous parts of the Bible illustrating these exact points. I was just being sarcastic because so many American conservatives insist on having military type guns

1,Tell her I said happy bornday
1,@Astute Cingulus it's what's happening today why I don't support BLM. They make it all about skin color. At first it starts peaceful but then there's destruction and nothing but pointing fingers. Google Tony Timpa. He was a innocent schizophrenic white man calling the police for help. White officers killed him. Because it was white on white you didn't see it everywhere you go. Not even on the news.
1,I noticed that within engineering schools
1,That melted my heart.
1,@Taylor Bridges¬† Hey Dummy Maria Botina was a Russian agent that infiltrated the NRA. She laundered millions to Trump and she went to prison.nnSo is it illegal for BLM to support Democrats. If so lock them up the way Giuliani's boys Lev Parnas and Igore Fruman were arrested for laundering Russian cash to Trump and other Republicans. Oh I forgot FOX didn't want you to know that. nnOh you might want to know the Trump Foundation was shut down by regulators. Trump was using the money for himself. Oh my I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.

1,Where did the Sheriff go?? We need him back...ü§∑‚Äç
1,BLM was founded as a reaction to UNPUNISHED police abuses and historic targeting and escalation of force used on black and brown people. nAll Lives Matter is a 'what about' red herring fallacy to deflect to conversation away from the complaint. If you 'what about' an argument
1,Just a friendly reminder that democrats are for black live matter.... For your own sake... Vote properly on November

0,I wanna be an engineer but I suck at math. But I like chemistry and physics...
1,My own personal view of this is the statue was a reminder of what should not of happened in history ... so should of been left as an embarrassing reminder.  Also the obvious many people there in the crowds are going to catch covid and maybe die ..... so not only will they get ill or die but some poor NHS worker (from whatever ethnic background) will have to look after them and risk there own life doing so ...
1,shut up he an industry plant! stay woke
1,@kris c sin? Gurllllll. Everyone sins
1,Just look at what is happening now
1,@mya kahlo hahaha your whole argument fell apart. You can't hold BLM accountable for what some protesters say in the heat of a protest. The Dallas shootings were an isolated incident. The BLM does not condone violence nor does it hate police officers. nice to see you've admitted you're against it when you've been dismissing it the whole time. Also your profile picture and linked google account shows you're a white male so I have trouble believing anything you say at all. Nice to see you also like to victim blame and that basically black people should just deal with racism because the world is not out to get them when it so blatantly is. Colorblind racism at its finest.nnKeep liking your own comments though. It probably makes you feel better.
1,I feel bad for laughing about him getting beaten by a bible

1,I saw a guy making a jet engine. or a mad scientist with a new type of something unlimited power. lol
1,What still shocks me is that Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden use black culture constantly for votes and recognition. Nancy wore a traditional African tribal scarf to ‚Äúrelate and stand with the BLM movement‚Äù even though Africa has absolutely nothing to do with the BLM movement or American system

1,@Molly Rebekah You mean disapprove with acts of homosexuality. Homosexuals exists
1,Its amazing that this video is from 2016 and look how history repeats itself. Its almost like these are not organic movements but political puppets brought out only when an election year happens too stoke conflict and division. Go look at who funds BLM. George Soros and now even China is backing them with millions of dollars which gets funneled through Actblue and goes straight too fund DNC candidiates.

0,Tenacious Tacosnthere tends to be this antagonism towards women stating their point of view because it is automatically viewed as misandrist and discriminatory against men when paradigms like sexism and racism are not symmetrical because of the historical precedents where one group has been favored more than another. These scholarship initiatives are merely attempts to balance an unbalanced game. Not to take from opportunities that were already there- supplement not supplant. There's enough to go around

1,@Indigenous Supporter Thanks for the interesting info

0,To say black lives matter is to say that one race is worth more than another. Racism in its basic form is the belief that one race is better than or more superior. You put a color on what matters and you are racist. BLM is just another attempt at political prostitutes trying to find new Johns.

1,This was five years ago and it's still an agenda today. BLM is a controlled organization that creates division.  You can't even say  All Lives Matter without being called a racist or facing backlash. I mean it's so obvious to see that other groups are using BLM as a front for their own agendas and narratives. The woke ones know what's going on.

1,Just not understanding why black folks look to white people to solve all their problems. Isn't that a formnof racism. Why can't they solve their own problems using the court systems and the hundreds of organizations that have been set up and funded to help them. Will they always take the victim posture.

1,This is 100% true. But your oppinion cannot change the fact that the world has a race problem. You can choose to ignore it but it's there. All lives cannot matter until black lives matter. It is not possible for all lives to matter if we/other races keep on blowing up innocent black people.

1,Trayvon Martin was sacrificed by his Masonic parents. Wow they‚Äôre really something aren‚Äôt they? nBLM is a marxists group designed to divide Americans by race. nThis is a direct result of America foreign policy and how we treat other countries. No wonder they are trying to divide America. After all we have done to other nations. nWhich leads me to my next statement. The Us government is incompetent and should be taken over by the people. America‚Äôs government does not represent the people.

1,@BackYardTV How could white owned land in SA be stolen land? That's racist to think that blacks own the whole continent of Africa. It would be like Europe or North America confiscating all the black owned property
1,Clearly not when that video is full of them.
0,So human lives matter would be a good slogan to fight for.
1,No you‚Äôre missing the point. When a black life is taking there is no consequence to the police. When a white man takes a white man‚Äôs life the life matters when a black man takes a black male life the wife matters when an agent man takes an Asian man life the life matters. But when you have cops killing black people regularly on camera and getting away with it. You tend to believe black lives don‚Äôt matter. Because if it was white people in those situations it would never have had happened. So then you have to ask yourself do black lives matter to the American government and the judicial system. The answer is no! Do all lives matter yes of course that‚Äôs been established. Now let‚Äôs talk about the lies that are being taken by the people who are supposed to protect us. Stop avoiding the point. I can‚Äôt even believe they talking about in all lives matter debate versus a black lives matter debate. The day you see all lies being treated the way black people has been treated then we will have it all lives matter debate.

1,@Denise Farias It's been a long time since I've written that comment and I've looked into this topic and I agree with you.

1,@DragyTD People are reaching. Not once did anyone say 'ONLY black people lives matter' but when you're talking about stuff like 'Save the Turtles' people don't automatically assume that those that say it are saying that we should save ONLY turtles. People just don't want black people to have things to themselves. All the time we are expected to share our stuff. So people can stop lying about 'it implies that only black lives matter'. When SE Asians were being discriminated against in the UK and America not ONCE did someone say ALM and not once did people mention the struggles that people of other races go through UNTIL people said BLM. They didn't care before

0,There are only two sexes (and also intersex people so technically three sexes) but gender identity is up to the person. It‚Äôs a very western idea that there are only two genders and many other cultures believe differently and have believed differently for thousands of years. If a person wants to express their gender as something non binary to boy and girl they should have the freedom to do so. If they aren‚Äôt hurting anyone else why make them change into something they aren‚Äôt comfortable with

0,It's not about black lives. It's all about the tactics of intimidation by the police that sometimes escalates a situation and will lead to excessive force and generally due to the lack of cooperation by the suspect. When one's freedom is at stake one's instincts will lead to defending that Liberty and often times this is precipitated by the police officer allowing his emotions to get the best of him. It doesn't matter what race you are what matters is

Kitties will always be there for you...
0,As someone who dosnt really feel comfortable saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm religious‚Äù but would say my beliefs fall most closely to Christianity and attends church regularly... this whole concept of conversation therapy disgusts me. I have read the Bible through and through. Yes the Bible does say that homosexual actions are sinful. It also says a thousand other things are sinful (things we are all guilty off in our lifetime) the Bible clearly says all sin is forgivable. The Bible says the greatest commandment is love. Jesus when faced with the option to condemn chose love over and over and over again. He forgave and he showed compassion. In fact the only people Jesus was super blunt or ‚Äúmean‚Äù with. Was not the drunkerds
1,More white men are killed by police that black people

1,@Forest Gump in 200 years time if it turns out that society finds the practice of making computers abhorrent for reasons that we don't understand today should we tear down statues of tech company executives who donated large sums of money to charity. Do people like Bill and Melinda Gates become cannon fodder to history? No we appreciate their kind work in the standards of their time. Honestly put some donation boxes on the statue and donate the funds to a slavery museum like the one in Liverpool. History is done. Nobody expects the vikings the pay back for the monasteries they burned or monks they enslaved. People that unfairly discriminate their fellow man today against modern values or argue that the slave trade was good today are the menace

1,Syed Abdul Wasay I don't really like posting things but I'd like to mention that this is one of aggravating videos to watch as an engineer. The fact that this happens and is being gender specific even though I
1,I came from a video that shows a man who worked for silicon valley saying that one of the reason that he quit his job because there was a report against him that he belittle a female engineer in the marketing department.nnThat report stuck on him even though he made an appeal 3 times to 3 higher people put the report wasn't removed from his yearly evaluation.nnMy guess on the one the first lady and the African one

1,@Maggie Paulu are incorrect when u say backs are killed more than white by police as in 2019 police killed 1004 people in America but 250 were black that leaves around 650 were of other races and considering whites are the most common race in America that mean a large amount of that 650 were white. And all lives matter was just a slogan but is now a movement as things change though time and so do people. But I'm white

0,+SeizmosnWhat our media spews and what the actual general population thinks and feels ain't even remotely close tho. The media is only representing the high upper class
1,Statistics are statistics. An engineer DEFINITELY knows that. One should be empowered by the fact that they are going against the norm. Not dethroned. But that's just my thoughts on the matter.nHowever I wouldn't say this is rampant sexism. Although I'm just glad no one used fucking buzzwords like misogyny or bigots and other feminist bullshit. They exclusively talked about their experiences rather than pushing some feminist agenda.nnThis wouldn't have been disliked so much if it wasn't for the fact that the title and face of the video (initial reaction
1,Hey ppl i posted in the comments the link with the video of her stating the trained marxist did it not make it to the comment section? Because i can see my comment with the link. So im a bit surprised why people are still asking for a link or didnt even bother to check the video themselves...

1,@BenjoBanjoo like the Tories and Brexit?
1,The civil war was caused because white people wanted to keep slavery. And you don‚Äôt have to agree with the political views of the BLM foundation. But we should all agree that black lives matter. That Marxist view does not define our movement and it does not take away what we are trying to accomplish
1,??? Really? Black means brown or African.
1,Agreed. We're born the as the sexualities we are so it'd be like saying I don't agree with black people

1,Some sjw protesters have literally ran into the fronts of stopped cars and then reported that they were rundown they feel so entitled to pity and victimhood which is turning a good idea spreading awareness into  just making black lives matter people seem like they have a victim complex well they're tossing over gay pride parades
1,Just shows you how long they plan stuff and sometimes how long it takes to process it into place

1,black people are not trying to be more important than other races. we are trying to tell you that we matter because we are going through bad things that other races have not experienced before. So we are trying to get you to notice that we matter so we could be equal with the other. we are not trying to be on top of the other races. we want to be equal.
1,It‚Äôs rude to attack someone who talking and the other person interrupts.  I applaud the cop. Saying black lives matter is saying remember us to. Stop. No one is stupid. Shame on you guys

1,@Sandy Castles In a indirect way your right. Depending on the school you can get very good results.  Schools are funded by property taxes and overseen by parents.nIn a bad neighborhood there is little money and little oversight.  Hence its not the State but the collective concern or lack of that determines the average outcome.   But to blame the State is a strawman argument.
1,LilyBella I‚Äôm asian and we need to be here for other minorities

1,Remember who sold the slaves in Africa to the Europeans.
1,Anyone care to guess how many police officers are killed by blacks every year?
0,Saying Black Lives Matter doesn't mean Screw everyone else who isn't black. Why don't White Americans get that?nThe fact that a group of people have to stand in protest and practically scream Hey! We deserve the right to life! because of the recent publicly exposed police brutality should be the concern here. Saying All lives matter is unnecessary and is doing an injustice to Black Americans. If all lives truly mattered then Black Lives Matter wouldn't be a movement so necessary today
1,‚Äã@themooch Your life does not matter. Sorry.
1,I think it's time to look in the mirror instead of looking at us. I've never owned a slave nor has anyone besides people in Libya. Obama killed the man that was going to free them. If black lives really mattered those slaves in Libya would be free. But gold was more important. That and Obama's role in knocking off countries for the cabal.
1,@Jun3 Shiroyuki oh really so the officer who put his knee of Flyod's neck would've done it to a white guy when this officer has a record of being racist and killing minorities
1,I am so happy and proud to live in the same time
1,It's also ironic that this is the south west of England which had a major problem of the (white) locals being enslaved and taken to Africa. Both clearly abhorrent sides of the same historical problem but not isolated to white skin colour by any means.

1,Floyd died from heart problems with 90% blockage in one artery and 75% in another.  Floyd was a career criminal who already spent 7 years in jail mostly from home invasion with a gun put to a pregnant woman's stomach while his mob went through the woman's home stealing all her possessions.    Floyd feared going back to jail for his forgery scheme and the stress caused heart failure.  Floyd got his justice even though it should have been much earlier.  (Go to the Stefan Molyneux channel for a good video about Floyd).

1,Hey- a lot of the people you may be thinking of did nothing against the law. You might not be aware about a kid foot instance called Elijah McClain who was going to the store and had the cops called as he was looking suspicious. Look up the story. Or other people who were just going home. I know people stopped constantly in their own car. On the way to work. In their Worker's Uniform. You know better now than to make a blanket statement like this.
1,They thought it's cool to protest.
1,For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27¬†and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another
1,@Bbm add#11 Nobody has mentioned killing babies in this thread. Not even once. Maybe you're referring to abortion

1,@chris chris Same with whites..racism is Not about Supremacy it's about Ignorance.
1,@Anna ._. sorry but why?? nothing really wrong with this statement other than it could've been phrased better. to a kid

1,It is not a celebration these days. It's a historical reminder
1,Sherriff Clark is da man
1,MrCosmin94 and your statement ‚Äúopening‚Äù people‚Äôs minds is completely invalid when you yourself have no prior knowledge to a actual topic. And making a point as bland as ‚Äúwho created god ‚Äú is like asking which universe created the universe. Because from a naturalistic view there has to be a natural non divine explanation. And based on the Laws of thermodynamics energy can‚Äôt just appear and disappear but be constant. So when you take nothing and create an infinite expanding universe with finite energy that is always constant and never created or taken away you come to question how that energy got there in the first place? It is the reasonable human reaction. So to tell people who have found peace in an answer for themselves makes you someone that can‚Äôt stand others happiness or comfortability. You would think being a human being you would have more compassion towards others and their own choices. Like I don‚Äôt judge you for yours
1,@TheLegend27 Is Alive I'm glad that you agree and stuff
1,@Healthcare Matters How's that??
1,Black lives matter claims they are being oppressed and their children os being denied a education.
1,@Rigo Batiancila That's where you're a bit wrong like Ashton Kutcher said yes all lives matter but to some racist people black lives don't matter when it should matter here! Therefore BLM is not a disgrace here!

1,This video is so pointless.nThe women themselves look bored as shit and provide no proper facts or incidences within their working environments that prove Silicon Valley institutions are sexist.nThe fact that there are way less females in this employment sector is NOT sexist.

1,leo A I agree with u on that & it‚Äôs always Politics when Dems act stupid Election time
0,Being pro-life and pro-sterilization is not hypocritical. nnBasically you can believe that a mother shouldn't get herself pregnant AND believe that if she does get herself pregnant that she shouldn't be allowed to murder her kid.nnThis is no stranger than pro-life people advocating abstinence. They're not trying to make sure women have babies; they just don't approve of murdering children.
1,How is that soft butch homophobic
1,And I‚Äôll talk to you like an adult. If I get stabbed in my femoral artery and blood is gushing out it‚Äôs not fair to look at me and look at someone with a Papercut and say that you‚Äôll help the person with the paper cut first(Papercut is white bleeding out of your femoral artery is every other person). It‚Äôs not saying that you don‚Äôt have a problem it‚Äôs saying that our problem is way worse than yours.
1,No...lol It could be just someone who disagreed with lgbt+ that‚Äôs what I told my mom
0,Jens I‚Äôm not offended by black lives matter. The first comment in this topic was about how the slogan was racist. I went on to say that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs racist but I had my concerns how it could be causing a divide and doing more harm than good . nA good number of the comments on here say it‚Äôs racist so clearly some people have an issue with it
1,There literally is no right side to BLM it doesnt matter what side you're on. You're always going to be wrong in someone's eyes.

1,@you are totally right
1,Black lives do matter and anyone who says different need to go put some duck tape over their mouths! And other lives matter to but we need to work at one thing first then go to the next if we go out and say this life matters and starts a whole protest it will get out of control we should take it one at a time.
1,ALL lives matter period.  I am surprised i never saw this article till now.
1,Black Lives Mater Agenda....whats your thoughts?
1,Bot gonna lie but the BLM movement is the biggest racist thing I've ever seen (aside from slavery). I don't know about you guys but I saw one human being unjustly kill another human being. So shouldn't it be human lives matter

1,@Johnathan nostar Um...Jesus did exist
1,God gave us a choice
1,Can we stop with this idiotic argument? People are saying Black Lives Matter because they think black lives are oppressed and they should be pumped up to the same level as other lives. It's wrong but that's what they think. End of argument. Can we now focus on all the traitors to this country? Like the governor of Seattle letting an autonomous community spring up in front of his eyes? Or the victimhood mentality that is damaging MOST youth? It's a whole generation poisoned by leftist ideology. Hope they find a path in their lives and that they somehow develop a skill and a career. If not
1,She looks so beautiful
1,Bruh people have been racist to eachother for centuries. You can't let racism happen and it's not like people from the past cared that much about it.
1,I want to know why Blacks always bring up Slavery and never Mention that it was Blacks that sold them into Slavery? George Floyd should not be Memorialized as Victim of Race.¬†He was a Drug Dealer/Druggie and a Multi-Convicted Felon. His Career of Crime started when he was 16 years old. He was no Dr. Martin Luther King.

1,@Anesu Nambware I see you did not bother to mention anything about the WHITE woman that was murdered. I find the statement BLACK lives matter Offensive and RACIST towards me as It should have said ALL lives matter. The FACT you have to bring up MLK from over 50 yrs ago shows you still live in the past. I have always taken people at face value regardless of their skin colour but to try and rewrite history by pulling monuments down and wanting to get rid of things like the confederate flag and ban tv shows and movies is going to the extreme in my opinion. History is important as we should try and learn from it.

I am not familiar with law in USA but in my country if you officialy announce demonstration or parade or any public action like that and they aprove it (which they always do unless you are asking for something really silly) then any group blocking you during it will get removed by police quite swiftly. Why it was not like this in this case?

It seems they are doing everything but that. But we shouldn‚Äôt use this important movement to turn attention to something else that isn‚Äôt the matter at hand. We will fight for equality then we will spread out to those regions too. They are all equally as important but we have to stay focused. I hope you understand this.

I have no faith in god yet I'm healthy and happy but many of my family members who go to church everyday are ill

1,@Darzo Xx It was created for a backlash and discussion. I don't think anyone in the movement wants to play nice. This is about real issues that have been ignored for a long time because we are usually all stuck at our jobs and can't pay attention or paying attention is too uncomfortable. The slogan means business and was made to generate discussion.

0,If I have learned anything from this woman it is that corporations dictate way too much by deciding how girls and boys should live.

0,@ozzie pants¬†nnThe reason I say I believe there could be closer to a 50-50 distribution in engineering is because there are many women who have strong enough math skills to go into the field who are currently choosing to go into other disciplines.n----I agree that women with high scores are likely to choose other majors. Female math geniuses are usually stronger in other subjects as well. Like I said before

1,@natalie bogle The only issue with racing this country is people convinced that there's a problem in making one and then the people that have nothing to say and they don't know what to do about life it gives them something to get rallied up and worked up about and then you get people that are antagonizers that know how to work people up like the organizers of that organization are admitted train Marxists they're trained to be able to rally people and get them worked up they admit it in videos figure that one out so it kind of like takes the narrative they created a narrative to push their agenda a false narrative to rally people to push this agenda

I don‚Äôt know where you got it from where I think if one person is dumb all of them are. I think you misunderstood me so just quote where you think I said something like that. And quote me where I said black lives matter most that one actually kinda pisses me off its hypocritical to say that. All I‚Äôm saying is that black lives matter and I shouldn‚Äôt have to explain myself when I say it. All it means is black lives matter. Not only black lives matter. Just black lives matter

And that peope don't only see the Christians speak wrongly in the name of God. I believe in a loving God who doesn't want me to be mean just because of an opinion I don't share with someone.

1,Watched this again 4 years later in 2020.  Same old crap.  Sorry we missed Sheriff Clarke in Kenosha.  Protestors against police in Milwaukee bringing young childre to the event..how will that shape children's perception of police officers as they grow up?  And a photographer stated that police show up aggressively.....well...wouldn't you be stressed out and on guard when people are calling for your harm?  I don't know if we can come back from this.

1,@Brian Driscoll¬†I doubt anyone became an engineer due the moon landings dude
1,The level  of ignorance Michael brown attack a police officer and try to get his gun!!!!
1,Mmmm. I would disagree. Religion is belief if you believe something hard enough it stops becoming a choice. People in soviet Russia were brainwashed to make them love Stalin. They couldn‚Äôt make an active choice to deny it because that‚Äôs the way they perceived the world around them. It‚Äôs like seeing a green apple and trying to convince yourself it‚Äôs not green. It‚Äôs almost impossible because that‚Äôs how you see it. If a religious person sees homosexuality as wrong and believe it enough it becomes less of a choice and more of  a perception of the environment around them.
1,So at this time. And for a long time. Black and brown are abused and murdered at a high rate. So it‚Äôs nothing wrong with accentuated and pointing out the obvious.  What about statistics ?

1,Can you please do a video on the fact that if God made a man and a woman(2 people) then their children would have to have to reproduce with their parents or their siblings. I am pretty sure that somewhere in the Bible it says this is wrong. At least this is wrong by current law so by creating Adam and eve God was encouraging them to break at least moral law

1,@***** The movement began¬†in reaction to the deluge of unarmed black victims¬†of police (and wanna-be police) violence in the news recently. To get your panties all bunched up about the name is irrational. If you want to start a movement you can call it whatever you want.

1,@Iroor I never interpreted what you said as if you were saying the slogan needed changing.nI was merely emphasising the utter hypocrisy and intolerance on issues pertaining specifically to race. Why does Alm as a slogan have no relevancy to blue lives matter? This indicates to me a fundamental bias. You also overlooked my issue with all lives matter as it relates to counter protests against blm.
1,Poor lives matter. That's the true root of the issue.

1,Saying  All lives matter in response to Black lives matter is kind of ignorant almost a smart mouthed response. If a child told his mother I'm hungry and she responded Everyone gets hungry it undermines the child's point. The child didn't say everyone doesn't get hungry he was just bringing attention to his current hunger. In fact he's agreeing with her
1,I think that the girl who doesn‚Äôt agree with The LGBTQ+ community clearly doesn‚Äôt know enough about the subject to have a real opinion... my guess was that she was raised this way cause she didn‚Äôt really know who to describe why or how she disagreed. Just a thought

1,The only thing I find a little sad about this is that even when women show an interest in engineering. It seems in America and the UK there is no interest or acknowledgement of shop floor engineering everyone seems to think its design work what ever field it is when she said engineer what ever happened to a man/woman in overalls hunched over a machine actually creating what they have designed

0,@Kurt Sandberg if you are saying that in response to BLM then let me give you a lesson. The reason black lives matter started was because we want all lives to matter. Saying all lives matter is just being selfish and wanting to not feel like the bad guy. Because whites aren't bad

1,That's the difference between the average person and the researcher/analyst/scientist. The average person would look at that and take it at face-value then leave it that. The analyst would say hmmm I wonder why that is? There must be a reason or a cause for that to happen then they go do extensive research to figure it out & almost always the answer goes much deeper than just the simple oh it must be because they don't like it. Don't downplay the human psyche. Things are not always black and white.
1,White Lives Matter! White lives have been depreciated throughout decades. Whites are called racists because of skin color. Who wants to start a movement and march? We will accept all nationalities that will help honor white color. Don‚Äôt cause a white out! White privilege matters!!

When the speaker said that they were on 5 female students in the class...I remembered those days when we were also 5 girls and no excuses on all of our classes and demos. I am now 36 years old.

0,Think about it this way by only saying black lives matter you are putting down every other race including Native Americans. They have it every bad because they got pushed out of their homes where their beliefs are so their basically taking a page out of Hitler‚Äôs book and say that Black is the master race when that isn‚Äôt true because there is no master race everyone should be equal.

All ya have to do is watch LIVE PD...oh yea they pulled one of the most transparent police shows EVER! Every cop on LIVE PD is a very good one. I will say that Police use the knee to the neck ALL the time so let's not say this is a isolated incident. People have had problems with the knee to the neck restraint for a long time. Now we see why. The worst thing about David Clark is his uniform. All that flash ain't authorized and if it is...well then shame on the me!
0,That's horrible and inexcusable to do to another human being even more so a child! Whether a person agrees with homosexuality or not DOES NOT give them the right to play God and judge another on their sexual preferences. I believe in reading the Bible and showing love and acceptance in one another and focus on verses such as John 8

1,@Grizzly Bear  Trump has God in his heart but his actions speak louder then what's in his heart. Masters beat their slaves with a Bible in one hand and a whip in the other.

People wanting racial equality would not have to say anything if it was already equal.
1,she seems very genuine and emotional here. i feel like i‚Äôve not seen this side of her in forever. so much love
1,Republicans are so dysfunctional lol
0,All lives matter and frankly from what I've seen is that gun laws in America are yet again the true problem whether out of prejudice towards the colour of skin I think it's ludicrous the chances between the rich and poor are divided and that is where the true issue is it is difficult to get rid on one bigoted billionaire that so happens to be the president of the United States but laws around the world have no difficulties ridding poor people out of the society so therefore I'm afraid that the majority is playing a dangerous game of racial anger that can result in a civil war that would not be beneficial for whatever colour of skin you've put your bets on so when I say all lives matter I mean to say

1,Vanesa people aren‚Äôt making him into the great person to exist. He‚Äôs just an example of police brutality. And his death is so noticeable because he even told the officers that he can‚Äôt breathe. They aren‚Äôt just talking about him they are many other people others are talking about. And I get that he was a criminal but we don‚Äôt need to focus on that because that doesn‚Äôt mean he had to die when his death had nothing to do with what happened 5 years ago. If trump supporters can ignore the fact that trumps a racist and a rapist I think we can ignore what crimes George did five years ago.
1,I really want people to stop using religion as an excuse for ignorance

1,@Jason Devon Unfortunately the traditional definitions of right and left in politics have been completely distorted by the leftist 'woke' agenda. By traditional standards I would consider my political views to be slightly left of centre - for instance I'm in favour of universal healthcare and a compassionate welfare state. But by today's 'woke' standards I'd be branded as far right because I don't think transgender women should be allowed to compete in women's sport and I think this 'non-binary' stuff is attention seeking bullshit.

1,@Jose Luis statistics wise yes more White people are killed by Cops then black people.   But Also Statistics Wise more (Unarmed) Black people are killed by Cops there's a Difference.   Also Anyone Who has a Counter Protest like All Lives Matter are a Racist or Bigot because they don't care how many (Unarmed) (unjustly) Black people are being killed so once White privilege is Taken away ND White Supremacy we will have peace.

0,@Molly Rebekah Girl I'm Christian too and you are waaaaaaaaaaaaay outta line. What I'm taught from the bible and what I see it saying is that we should love all. Do you believe that God loves each and every one of us cause that's what we are taught as Christians that he loves everyone of us. So the fact you think God doesn't like LGBTQ people is misinformed because God loves all of us not just some of us ALL of us.nnIt's people like you that give us Christians a bad name because you want to make your own version of life where God only likes what you think and that's what you tell people. When in fact God loves all of us and wants us to love eachother like we want to be loved.  So before you come here claiming to be Christian go and rethink everything you think and read up on what God teaches us. nnnLike girl bye.

1,That sheriff has more testosterone than the Fire Lord
1,The reason that All Lives Matter has become an offensive statement is because that phrase only originated to counteract the Black Lives Matter movement. The All Lives Matter phrase was never popularized until Black Lives Matter became a strong force in the country.

1,@Indiana Rose nWhilst I hear what youre saying..the good thing about Christianity(not to be confused with hateful American evangelism) is that it evolves..through time..scientific discovery and public debate..you know we now no longer believe the earth is flat or execute people for working on the Sabbath...now we take our advice on sexuality from experts called sexologists...not bronze age dessert tribesmen who knew nothing about the complexities and diversified of human sexuality..in the UK senior clergy are calling for some now deceased homosexuals to receive recognition and award for their good works that benefited society.

1,GameRoll nHaven't you noticed that people do the same thing for all their fallen heroes and dearly departed?   The best time for cold analysis of a person's life is probably NOT shortly after he/she has gone.  Also people have a tendency to make IDOLS of the dead when it is politically or otherwise convenient.  We cannot blame Mr. Floyd for immoderate comments which others have made about him following his brutal murder.   For it remains a fact that he was murdered.   nnnNow I didn't hear any of these allegations about his behavior before.  It neither surprises me to hear it

1,Nothing wrong with the term all live matter. But it's only used because people started using black lives matter. It's used to drown out black lives matter.

1,MultiDarkZen I have no doubt that you think feminism is a hate group. You're just not the first one to say so in the past century and you won't be the last. There's a reason why academics tend to be feminists while uneducated people are not.nnI haven't watched the red pill but from what I read in Wikipedia it's a lot of the arguments I read from YouTube comments that blame class problems on women.

1,@Hippo Bottom Jeans Where? I didn't care that much till you brought it up.
1,If you think that black lives matter means only black lives matter you've shown your own ignorance this movement of black lives matter is a cry out saying black lives matter also... It is sick that a cop would shoot an unarmed or non lethally armed black man. Whites get killed by the cops but 9 times out of ten they were in the wrong the problem is the gross misconduct of excessive jail time and innocent black lives in jail. That's what these people started the black lives matter movement and it's media who have the responsibility to convey the grievances of the people yet you leave us wanting... There are bad protesters and there are bad cops but untill police brotherhood is disbarred and cops work like Walmart employees where they see someone in the wrong they stop it instead of covering it up we're gonna sit here and stew in the wreckage of our ignorance.

1,Zach Jerde no. Not ‚Äòend of discussion‚Äô calling someone an ‚Äòit‚Äô is the most de-humanising thing you could possibly do and that‚Äôs disgusting that you think that‚Äôs okay. An ‚Äòit‚Äô is what you call an inanimate object or an unidentifiable creature not a human being.
1,You don't get it do you. Black Lives Matter does not mean white lives don't. It just means Black lives are being treated unfairly by the police and this needs to stop. If there's a burning house you would try to save it and not say no but All Houses Matter... Your house isn't burning... Black people needs the BLM movement to get equality. Stop thinking about just yourself and imagine if you're black. You can get killed by just going for a jog

It is totally destructive. The poor are being kept poor black or white. It is the poor that has more interaction with the police and are more susceptible abuse by the police. The minimum wage needs to be high enough so that anyone with a full time job should be able to buy a home

All of my goals and everything I spend my time on is to become an engineer. I am now a Junior in high school and I have been on a robotics team for 5 years. I spend my time teaching other people about engineering and doing outreach events to inspire young kids to go into STEM. I am in a Pre-Engineering program. I created a STEAM event to teach kids how art and STEM are related. I have done all of this because of this single video. All the time and energy that I have put in I did because of this video. Thank you so much you gave me a passion I didn't know I had and it has changed my entire life. I know you won't see this but I feel in debt to you and I needed to thank you.

But step in your typical engineering classroom in America and then tell me that there are as many women interested in engineering as men. A gender inbalance   does not automatically mean discrimination

1,Lilyx Yeah well did you also know black man actually have a better chance of getting their life taken by another black man than a white police officer
1,There has never been a question of all lives matter. The fundamental issue is black lives matter the same. This country has never questioned the value of white lives. It has historically undermined the lives of black and brown lives. The movement is questioning systematic racism and trying to bring the country to a balance state by addressing black lives and making our lives matter as well. There is not a black person that doesn't understand all lives matter

0,I know that was so sweet of the boy to to say hope he knows is a good person
0,I could maybe be sympathetic if they were less vague. All I hear is them ascribing sinister motives to people who seem like they are just being overly friendly nerds.nAnd these testimonials right before the statstics on women engineers in Silicon Valley seem to imply that the reason that there are less women in tech there is because it is a hostile environment for women. But step in your typical engineering classroom in America and then tell me that there are as many women interested in engineering as men. A gender inbalance   does not automatically mean discrimination

1,I can't believe 5 years later....here we are again. Of course
1,You are ignorant. People don't say white lives don't matter when they say black lives matter. White lives have always mattered and valued more than black lives. To ignore the disproportionate targeting of black people is bizarre. Or maybe you think this society is a happy accident where black people are lesser beings and they made their bed. Saying black lives matter does not mean white lives don't. Saying all lives matter invalidate people that recognize that black people are subjected to racism. If you think black people are subjected to violence the same as whites you are seeing things from a bias that enjoys having power over others.
1,@Jonathan Mason I'm not reading all of that if you can't be bothered to use punctuation. Saying black lives matter does not state or imply that white lives don't matter. If someone stole your car and you went to the police
